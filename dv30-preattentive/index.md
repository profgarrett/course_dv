# Mapping values to visual elements through Pre-attentive attributes

Data visualization is the representation of *numbers* with *visual elements*. There are a variety of ways we can do this, so we call each mapping as a pre-attentive attribute.
# What is a table?

A table has rows and columns with numbers. The below shows an inventory of shepherds and herd from 1300BC. You can see that it has rows and columns, each with a cell recording data. **A table is not a chart!**

# Graphs use visual channels

A graph maps a number to a visual attribute. How many chart types can you think of to visualize this data?

**Number of World Heritage Sites**

| Country | Norway | Denmark | Sweden |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| 2004    | 5      | 3       | 13     |
| 2022    | 8      | 10      | 15     |

See [samples]([https://100.datavizproject.com/](https://100.datavizproject.com/))

Visual channels are also called pre-attentive attributes. Below are common channels:

- Position on a common scale
- Position on unaligned scale
- Length
- Tilt
- Area
- Color luminescence or brightness
- Color saturation or intensity
- Curvature
- Volume
- Depth (3D)

### Accuracy

How do these compare in accuracy? [Class activity](perceptual-accuracy.html)

Below are some charts showing the results of a crowd-sourced activity measuring accuracy. They are grouped into the (roughly-speaking) four levels of accuracy.

To summarize, in order from best to to worst:

1. Position (common scale, then stacked, and unaligned)
1. Length (unstacked, then stacked)
1. Angle (for pie charts)
2. Area (rectangular is slightly better than circular)
