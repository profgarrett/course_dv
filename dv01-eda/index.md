## What is EDA?

*Exploratory data analysis* is our primary approach

- Exploratory
- Data
- Analysis

Compare against *confirmatory data analysis*, more common used in your statistics class with hypothesis testing.

More focused on business data. CDA generally assumes that we do not have complete data. With EDA, we often have 100% of the available data.
## EDA Process

We can visualize EDA with legos:

- Look at the data with your eyes
	- Look for missing values, outliers, codings, etc...
	- Identify type:
		- String or number (integer v. decimal)
		- Continuous v. discrete
- Visualize each variable's *distribution*
	- Normal curve, uniform, exponential, bimodal
- Look for correlations between variables
	- Find cause and effect
	- Find control variables
- Tell a story
	- Develop a thesis
	- Create good data visualizations
	- Create a report or presentation	-

## Why care?

We need to move beyond traditional skillsets! It's no longer 'good enough' to have your core skills, you need to be able to pair those with data skills.
